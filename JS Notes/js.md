**what is javascript** <br>
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.<br>
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language made for client-side execution on the browser.<br>
JavaScript is an interpreted language instead of a compiled one.The browser interprets JavaScript’s source code, line by line and runs it.<br> 
***Event Handling***: JavaScript enables you to handle events and even generate custom events.
<br>

**what are its key features**<br>
***Client-side validations***
JavaScript is heavily used for easing the interactions between users and web applications. Towards this, validation plays a significant role. Validations can guide users to fill forms correctly with valid data and prevent spam submissions. <br>

***Platform Independent***
 it can run on any computer irrespective of the operating systems used. <br>

 ***Async Processing***
 JavaScript supports asynchronous behaviour through the use of Promises and Async functions. In Promises, we can make a request and attach a .then() clause to it, which only executes on the completion of the promise. The other alternative is to use the async-await syntax functions; async functions don’t execute sequentially but parallelly, which positively affects pages’ processing time and responsiveness. <br>

 ***Prototype-based***
 JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language, which means it uses the prototypal inheritance model instead of the commonly known class inheritance. This means instead of creating classes and deriving objects from them, we define the Objects prototype and use this object prototype to create more Objects of the same type. This behaviour is similar to the Object factory method, and thus such a design pattern is commonly seen in JavaScript code.<br>
